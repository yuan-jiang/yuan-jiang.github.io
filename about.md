I started my career about 7 years ago in software industry as a software quality engineer and now my daily work involves software testing, tools/scripts development, configuration/test automation, service monitoring/assurance and things like that that are related to the so-called 'DevOps', and etc.

But my personal interest and desire of focus is software testing automation as in the past few years though I've built testing automation framework myself and also developed quite a lot of test cases I always have the feeling there is still room for improvement before the potential of 'automation' can be fully realized.

List of some of the techs I know and touched a bit:

- Java/Python/Ruby/Shell
