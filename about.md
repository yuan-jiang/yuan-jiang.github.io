#About me, the site
I am basically a simple personal technical blogging site for note-taking. The guy who created me used to google for answers for any technical difficulties and then keep them as clips and notes in notebooks but over years has come to realize that time is seldom spent on actually going overing them. He made a decision to start producing and reproducing with the thought someone someday might happen to get here and find something more or less helpful.

#About me, the person
I started my career 7+ years ago in IT industry as a software quality engineer and now my daily work involves software testing, tools and scripts development, configuration and test automation, service monitoring and assurance, and etc.

List of some of the techs I know and touched a bit:
{% highlight bash %}
- Java/Python/Ruby/Shell
- Selenium/RobotFramework/TestNG/Nose/XUnit
- Jenkins/Go/Git/Gerrit
- Ansible/Puppet/Fabric
- OpenStack/Linux/Virtualization/Docker/Vagrant/Bosh
- Logstash/Elasticsearch/Kibana/Nagios/Graphite/Grafana
- PagerDuty/ThousandEyes/Stashboard
- RESTful/SOAP/HTTP/HTML/CSS/JS/Web
- etc.
{% endhighlight %}

I think simple is better so I try to make it so.
