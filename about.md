#About me, the domain
When it was being registered, there wasn't any meaning - just some randomly chosen letters put together that happened to be available, and it's also true even for now. It has nothing to do with IoE (Internet of Everything) or IoT (Internet of Things). But since I use it for personal blogging, I tried to figure out a meaning, and if not too far-fetched, here comes: what we essentially do with computer programming is: provide input, get output, fix error, ..., and finally it works, and that's ioeworks!

#About me, the site
Simple personal site for technical note-taking. Used to googling answers for any technical tips and tricks and then keeping them as clips and notes in notebooks but over years come to realize that time is seldom spent on actually going overing what's kept. So decided to start putting such stuff here with in mind that may get a better chance revisiting it and someone someday might also happen to get here and find something more or less helpful.

#About me, the person
Of the ordinary who JUST DO IT and career began 7+ years ago in IT industry as quality engineer and now daily work involves things like software testing, tools and scripts development, configuration and test automation, service monitoring and assurance, and etc.

List of some of the techs know a bit:
{% highlight bash %}
- Java/Python/Ruby/Shell
- Selenium/RobotFramework/TestNG/Nose/XUnit
- Jenkins/Go/Git/Gerrit
- Ansible/Puppet/Fabric
- OpenStack/Linux/Virtualization/Docker/Vagrant/Bosh
- Logstash/Elasticsearch/Kibana/Nagios/Graphite/Grafana
- PagerDuty/ThousandEyes/Stashboard
- RESTful/SOAP/HTTP/HTML/CSS/JS/Web
- etc.
{% endhighlight %}

I think simple is better so I try to make it so.

Besides work, football is the game I watch very often and badminton is the one I sometimes do.
