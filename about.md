#About me, the site
A simple personal site for technical note-taking. Used to googling answers for any technical tips and tricks and then keeping them as clips and notes in notebooks but over years come to realize that time is seldom spent on actually going overing what's kept. So decided to start putting such stuff here with in mind that may get a better chance revisiting it and someone someday might also happen to get here and find something more or less helpful.

#About me, the person
Guy of the ordinary who JUST DO IT and career started 7+ years ago in software industry as a quality engineer and now daily work involves things like software testing, tools and scripts development, test and configuration automation, service monitoring and assurance, and etc.

List of some of the techs know a bit:

- Java/Python/Ruby/Shell
- Selenium/RobotFramework/TestNG/Nose/XUnit
- Jenkins/Go/Git/Gerrit
- Ansible/Puppet/Fabric
