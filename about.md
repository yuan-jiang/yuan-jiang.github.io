## About me

### Technically

  > I used to work with ~~Java~~ as my primary programming language, together with ~~Python~~ sometimes.
  >
  > In the year 2018, I moved to Tokyo.  
  > Since when I started using **Ruby** as my primary programming language, together with *nodejs*.  
  > Now I am mainly a **Ruby on Rails** web developer.
  >
  > Of course, I still write *JavaScript* code whatsoever.

  > I like the `KISS` principle, and I always prefer to solve *problems* in a simpler way.

### Personally
  > I speak English at work, which is my 1st foreign language, because I work with international colleagues;  
  > I need communicate with local residents in Japanese, which is my 2nd foreign language;  
  > At home I chat with my family in Mandarin, which is my 2nd native language;  
  > When talking with my parents I'd always use the Sichuanese dialect, and it is my 1st native language.
  >
  > I used to watch football (eh...soccer) games, American TV dramas, and Japanese anime a lot, but not any more...  
  >
  > The only kind of tv dramas I still watch and follow nowadays is 刑事ドラマ.
