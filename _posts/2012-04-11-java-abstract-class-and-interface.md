- A class can extend only one abstract class;
- Can have protected, public and public abstract methods;
- Can have static, final, or static final variables with any access modifier;
- "is-a" relationship;
- Cannot be instantiated;


## Interface

- A class can implement multiple interfaces;
- Can have only public abstract methods;
- Can have only static final (constant) variables;
- "like-a" relationship;
