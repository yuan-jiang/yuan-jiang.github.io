A ruby `gem` is a software package that contains a reusable ruby application or library.

## Common use cases
{% highlight bash %}
# search gems
$ gem search rails

# install gems
$ gem install rails
$ gem install rails -v 5.2.3

# list installed gems
$ gem list
# list specific gems
$ gem list json
# list remote specific gems
$ gem list -r json

# find where a specific gem is installed
$ gem which json

# uninstall gems
# NOTE: one known bad point: it does not uninstall the dependent gems which were installed together: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952836/do-i-have-to-manually-uninstall-all-dependent-gems
$ gem uninstall rails
$ gem uninstall rails -v 5.2.3

# view docs of installed gems
$ gem serve

# download gems and unpack downloaded gems locally
# good for read the source code of interested gems
$ gem fetch json
$ gem unpack json-2.3.0.gem
# if gem is already installed, it unpacks to current directory
# if gem is not yet installed, it fetches it first and unpacks
$ gem unpack i18n
$ gem unpack i18n -v 1.6.0
{% endhighlight %}
